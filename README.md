Project title: Overcoming the practical challenges in implementing one-time pads for delayed and real time bi-directional communication <br>
<br>
Project Vision: This project is designed for individuals or institutions whose need is to send text and voice communications with unbreakable encryption. The aim of this project is to develop a practical encryption system for text and voice communications that will provide perfect encryption using one time pads. <br>

# üîê Secure OTP-based Communication System

This project provides a secure communication solution using One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption, ensuring theoretically unbreakable text and voice communication. It leverages Python applications, utilizing secure encryption mechanisms to protect privacy against interception.
